Should Disney make more action and adventure movies?\n<p>The confidence intervals from the bootstrap method for the intercept and coefficient do not contain the value zero, as we have already seen that lower and upper bounds of both confidence intervals are positive. These tell us that it is likely that the adjusted gross is significantly correlated with the action and adventure genres. </p>\n<p>From the results of the bootstrap analysis and the trend plot we have done earlier, we could say that Disney movies with plots that fit into the action and adventure genre, according to our data, tend to do better in terms of adjusted gross than other genres. So we could expect more Marvel, Star Wars, and live-action movies in the upcoming years!</p>"},{"metadata":{"dc":{"key":"68"},"tags":["sample_code"],"trusted":false,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# should Disney studios make more action and adventure movies? \nmore_action_adventure_movies = ...","execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"dc":{"key":"68"},"tags":["tests"],"hide":true,"trusted":false,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"%%nose\n# %%nose needs to be included at the beginning of every @tests cell\n\n# One or more tests of the student's code\n# The @solution should pass the tests\n# The purpose of the tests is to try to catch common errors and\n# to give the student a hint on how to resolve these errors\n\ndef test_more_action_adventure_movies_type():\n    assert isinstance(more_action_adventure_movies, bool), \\\n        'more_action_adventure_movies should be of Boolean type.'\n    \ndef test_conclusion():\n    assert more_action_adventure_movies, \\\n        'That is not a reasonable conclusion given the values of confidence intervals.'","execution_count":0,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"name":"python3","display_name":"Python 3","language":"python"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.7","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2}
